- Hi, welcome!
- I specialize in in Full-Stack Development
- I’m currently learning Ethical Hacking
- I’m looking to collaborate on, honestly I have no idea yet.
- How to reach me through my email: krystamcalister@outlook.com
- Pronouns: She/Her
- Plot twist! Totally a bug, not a feature! I debugged a relationship and accidentally discovered my passion for tech. Turns out, my ex was a total syntax error. Who knew debugging a bad relationship would launch my true calling?
